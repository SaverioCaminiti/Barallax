This must be a JQuery object (corresponding to either a single element or to a set of elements in the page DOM).\r\n* horizontal background position: this is simply the horizontal component of `background-position`, use either a percentage or a pixel value here.\r\n* speed multiplier: this tells how slow the background should move with respect to the page scrolling. E.g., if the speed is .25 and the page scrolls by 200px the vertical component of `background-position` will be 200*.25 = 50px.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice that you can manipulate the `background-position` of any element based on page scrolling, you're not limited to the body background.\r\n\r\nMoreover, you can add several elements to the same instance of Barallax by calling `addSlowBackground()` more than one time.\r\n\r\nBarallax can also monitor the scrolling of block elements other than the main page. Simply specify which block you want Barallax to monitor whe you create it:\r\n```js\r\nvar barallax = new Barallax($('#myScrollingBlock'));\r\n```\r\nThe parameter must be a JQuery object and if it refers to a set of elements, only the first one is used.\r\nThen you simply call `addSlowBackground()` to add targets.\r\nYou can even have several instances of Barallax that monitor different scrollable elements.\r\n\r\nOpen to sample2.html to see this in action.\r\n\r\nA few final remarks on speed mnultiplier:\r\n* speed > 1 let the background scroll faster than the page/block, this may be used for some cool effect.\r\n* negative speed values let the background scroll in opposite direction with respect to the page/block, kind of crazy.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Boxed background\r\nTo apply this effect you simply have to specify target and horizontal background position, the vetical background position is automatically interpolade between 0 and 100% based on the relative position of each target with respect to the scrolling block (or page).\r\n```js\r\nbarallax.addBoxedBackground($(\".myTarget\"), \"50%\");\r\n```\r\nThis effect assumes that the target is inside the scrolling block, if it is not true you may see something strange due to the fact that vetical background position goes below 0% or over 100%.\r\n\r\nRefer to sample3.html for a WhatsApp-like chat effect and to sample4.html for something that resembles the iOS meteo location list.\r\n\r\n### Remove\r\nWhat to remove a background scroll effect previously associated? Just retain the value returned by and add method and use the appropriate remove method. \r\n```js\r\nref = barallax.addSlowBackground($(\"#myTarget\"), \"50%\", .5);\r\n...\r\nbarallax.removeSlowBackground(ref);\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\nref = barallax.addBoxedBackground($(\"#myTarget\"), \"0%\");\r\n...\r\nbarallax.removeBoxedBackground(ref);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Update\r\nBarallax watch for window resize events to update correctly but if you create a Barallax instance for a scrolling block and this block is resized without a window resize (e.g., programmatically) then you have to force the Barallax instance to update manually.\r\n```js\r\nbarallax.update();\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nBarallax by [Saverio Caminiti](http://saverio.caminiti.eu/) released under MIT license.\r\n\r\nBarallax depends on [JQuery](http://jquery.com/) and  uses [requestAnimationFrame polyfill](https://gist.github.com/paulirish/1579671) by Erik MÃ¶ller.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
